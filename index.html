	  <p>Welcome!</p>
	  <p>Pick a day to see which stations had bikes at different times.</p>
	  <p>Once the data for that day loads you can use the slider at the bottom to see how availability varies over the day. You can use the drop down next to the slider to toggle between bikes and docks.</p>
	  <p>This shows you general trends for every half hour, with a green dot, yellow, and red indicating 3+, 1 or 2, and 0 bikes available respectively. if you want to see more specifics about a station, click on it. This will load a graph of availability spanning the hour before and after the currently selected time.</p>
	  <p>Some stations are always low on bikes at certain times of day, and others vary a lot, to help visualize this for any weekday can click the 'Overlay pervious weekdays' link above the graph, and it will show you how today compares to the last five weekdays.</p>
	  <p>Of course availability varies with time of year, weather, other station conditions, and current rebalancing programs - but hopefully this helps you get a little more insight into your local citibike stations! I made this in large part because I was enjoying my citibike commute so much more than packing onto the train that when I moved I wanted to see which apartments were citibike friendly, and the only way to do that was to check the app each morning when I woke up and when I left work.</p>
