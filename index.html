	<p>Welcome, this is a map to help you explore the availability of citibikes/docks for a given day in the past. I personally find citibiking to be the most fun and healthy way to get around New York, but finding that there are no bikes available or even worse no docks once you have a bike out is frustrating. Because I find a biking commute so much nicer than packing into the train, before my last move I started checking the citibike map regularly and seeing which hours there were and were not bikes at the stations near my potential new apartments. Whether you're equally devoted to finding a citibike friendly apartment, trying to decide if a membership would work for your commute, or just curious which parts of the city have bikes at what hours, this website is intended to help you.</p>
	<p>To use this map, first select the day in the past you're interested in from the date picker in the top left. Wait while the page downloads the data for that day, and then expore by moving the timeslider on the bottom of the map and select bikes/docks from the drop down in the bottom right. The map shows data for every 30 minutes through the day. A green dot indicates 3+ available bikes/docks, yellow 1-2, and red 0. You can zoom and move the map, and to get more information about a specific station click on it. You'll see a more detailed graph of availabilty over the hour before and after the time you have selected.</p>
